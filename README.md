#  Clima

Built using the skeleton from @angelabauer (https://github.com/appbrewery/Clima-iOS13).

This app on startup, fetches the user's current location weather data, and displays it through text and image updates. Using the text field at the top of the screen, users are able to type in a city's name, and fetch the city's weather data of choice.

This project highlights the use of:
1. Combination of MVC and Delegate design patterns
2. Dark-mode enabled UI
3. Using extensions
4. Networking via URLSession and parsing JSON packets
5. Using CoreLocation to get the user's current GPS coordinates
